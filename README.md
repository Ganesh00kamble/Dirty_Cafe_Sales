# Dirty_Cafe_Sales
Dirty Cafe Sales Data Analysis &amp; ML Project  This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dirty cafe sales dataset. I performed data preprocessing, handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and built basic machine learning models to predict sales. This project helped me understand real-world data cleaning and ML workflow.


#Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

#Project Workflow:
1. Dataset understanding
2. Data cleaning & handling missing values
3. Encoding categorical features
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R2 Score)
